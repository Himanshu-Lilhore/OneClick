# OneClick

A browser extension designed to streamline manual testing tasks, reducing repetitive actions for select applications.

## Features:

1. **One-Click Selection:** Easily choose multiple options from a dropdown menu with just one click of a button.
   
2. **Visual Highlighting:** Each generated 'OneClick' button corresponds to the dropdown's border color, ensuring intuitive usage.

4. **Single button for all Binary questions:** All the Yes-No questions present on the page (radio buttons or dropdown) can be answered with a single button.  

## How to Use:

1. Download the extension from [Microsoft Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/oneclick/glhmdjhpacepphpanbihpaidmgfbppkg) or load it onto your browser directly. 
2. Navigate to the desired application or webpage where manual testing is required.
3. Identify dropdown menus where multiple options need to be selected.
4. Click the 'OneClick' button generated next to the dropdown to instantly select predetermined options.

## Motivation:

The 'OneClick' project was born out of a dual motivation - to learn MERN stack technologies and to address the repetitive nature of manual testing tasks. As a Quality Assurance enthusiast, I recognized the need for a tool that could simplify and expedite the testing process, leading to the creation of 'OneClick'. My aim is to empower QA professionals with a user-friendly solution that enhances productivity and efficiency in their daily workflows.

## Coming Soon:
- Additional functionalities to further streamline manual testing processes.
